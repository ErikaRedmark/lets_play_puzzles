# Assembly of the Planners
This is a solution finder, as well as solution drawer, for the Jewels of the Oracle puzzle Assembly of the planners.

And it will find solutions. Just make sure you have some time to make coffee, see a movie, see your friends, practise golf, and get a good nap in. This program iirc (I wrote these readmes year(s) after I wrote the code) runs about as fast as Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

# Disclaimer
I provide this code only as companion to my Let's Play videos. It was used only to get the answers I wanted as quickly as possible. _Do Not Use Any Of My Work As An Example Of Good Python Code_. I am not a python developer and I assure you it is very much terrible code.
