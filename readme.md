# Eh wah?
You can safely skip over this repo if you haven't watched my Jewels of the Oracle let's play. Any code I wrote in the process of solving or showing how to solve some of the puzzles in that game is here for others to examine.

# Git Ignore?
Some odd names and extensions are there. That's because my code was mixed with my let's play materials to some degree, but I didn't want to upload all of that to github.

# Disclaimer
I provide this code only as companion to my Let's Play videos. It was used only to get the answers I wanted as quickly as possible. _Do Not Use Any Of My Work As An Example Of Good Python Code_. I am not a python developer and I assure you it is very much terrible code.
